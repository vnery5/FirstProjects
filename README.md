# FirstProjects
My first projects done in Python (or in any programming language),
all of which are only text-based and probably could've been done
a lot more efficiently. But that's the art: learning by doing it.
The projects are:
  a game of tic-tac-toe (between two unnamed players)
  a game of Blackjack between one named player and a automated dealer
    (im really proud of how I was able to track the player's money and betting - I didn't use chips btw)
